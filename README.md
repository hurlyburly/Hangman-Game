# Hangman-Game
Hangman-Game written in Javascript
This game is built as an introduction to Javascript for those of us in the UMN coding bootcamp. 
If you go to the site: https://hurlyburly.github.io/Hangman-Game/ you should be able to play an interactive game of hangman with Dogs being the theme. 
I'm currently the only contributor to this project and have currently "completed" it, but as I learn more about javascript I might come back to this and see if I can't snazz it up and make it more interactive.
